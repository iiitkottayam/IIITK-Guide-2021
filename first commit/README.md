# First Commit

You might now know that we need to upload our code in github for other people to see and use it. It's like sharing and caring the community which gives you many things. 


We made a [meme page](https://joshi008.github.io/gitify-meme/)

Now your task is to add a meme ;) 

Google search any meme or reddit search it or any thing => We want a link of image

Now follow the below steps:

1. Fork this [repository](https://github.com/joshi008/gitify-meme)
2. Always it is best practise to work in a development branch rather than a main branch.
3. Create a new branch (git )
